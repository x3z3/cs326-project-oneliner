# **[one-liner] â€“ *Simple Dash***
**One-Liner :** The name 'One-Liner' was inspired by chaining a million methods into one line to create this intricate single page application.

## **Application Idea**

Simple Dash is a slick dashboard designed for productivity. It displays the clock, a productivity timer, current song playing, and goals for the day. It supports two modes:  
1. Browser mode (Similar to a browser homepage)
2. Screens mode (Best for Projectors or Smart Mirrors)


There are many productivity applications and browser extensions available for users, but many of these lack in simplicity and accessibiliy. Our application idea seeks to meet the needs of a diverse set of users, ideally providing an intuitive dashboard for your virtual space. By integrating a clock and study timer, weather widget, Spotify/Apple Music/Youtube player controls, and a notes section, users would be able to start their day efficiently and simply from a single tab.

We think this took could help meet the needs of students, people who work from home, and more. I (Felicia) have personally struggled to find effective digital tools that help me manage my anxiety ADHD, and I know how hard it can be to avoid distracting UI. For those on the autism spectrum or with sensory sensitivity, bright colors and excessive visual stimuli can ruin an otherwise helpful tool. I hope to collaborate with Anshul in thoughtfully designing an app that is accessible to neurodivergent communities, and helpful to anyone who gives it a try.

## **Functionality**

1. **Clock**: Has a clock display for the local time. Should have additional features such as switching formats, and timezones.
2. **Weather**: Has the local weather, updated often. 
3. **Study timer**: A productivity feature similar to [Pomodoro](https://pomofocus.io/).
4. **Task**: Editable list of tasks to complete for the day.
5. **Notes**: Editable list of notes.
6. **Spotify Player**: A Spotify media player built around the app's theme ([yt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqisCZG9MAc), [blog](https://jmperezperez.medium.com/playing-with-the-spotify-connect-api-f5c8cb62a849)).
